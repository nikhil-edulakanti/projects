### Summary

This code is a simple implementation of the Connect Four game using JavaScript, jQuery, and HTML. The game is designed to be played in a web browser, where two players take turns dropping colored chips into a grid. The goal is to get four of their own colored chips in a row either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

#### Key Components

1. **Player Setup**:
   - Prompts each player for their name and assigns them a color (blue for player one and red for player two).

2. **Game Variables**:
   - `game_on`: A flag to control the game state.
   - `table`: A jQuery selector for the table rows in the game grid.

3. **Functions**:
   - **`reportWin`**: Logs the winning coordinates to the console.
   - **`changeColor`**: Changes the color of a button at a specified row and column.
   - **`returnColor`**: Returns the current color of a button at a specified row and column.
   - **`checkBottom`**: Finds the lowest available row in a column to drop a chip.
   - **`colorMatchCheck`**: Checks if four given colors are the same (not gray or undefined).
   - **`horizontalWinCheck`**: Checks for horizontal wins in the grid.
   - **`verticalWinCheck`**: Checks for vertical wins in the grid.
   - **`diagonalWinCheck`**: Checks for diagonal wins in the grid.
   - **`gameEnd`**: Ends the game and displays the winning player's name.

4. **Game Flow**:
   - Starts with player one.
   - Player selects a column to drop their chip.
   - The chip is placed in the lowest available row in that column.
   - Checks for any winning combinations (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal).
   - Switches to the other player if no win is detected.
   - Ends the game and announces the winner if a winning combination is found.
